Python, Pyglet

This is a basic test, I'm not that clever with opengl, bugs are probably rampant!

~~get 30 fps on my laptop and I'm not sure why it isn't going crazy fast, the
entire list of 3k poygons is in a display list and I'm lost on how to make it
better,~~

Okay so it has to deal with context switching or something, as I discovered like
4 years ago, when you order the geometry by texture, it's insanely fast.  This
explains why so many games do a "texture stitching" step.  Put it all into one
texture and move it around by UV's

I get like 1000 fps on a GTX 770 and it's hard to actually walk around right,
since the movement isn't time based.  Happy to have found the old source code in
order to update this
